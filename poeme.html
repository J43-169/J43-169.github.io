    <p>
I once saw a crow.<br>
It froze into the night like the rough strings of a tapestry,<br>
And I saw its eyes, two new moons, painted with stars.<br>
It ran from tree to tree, jaggedly, like a highwayman fleeing on his horse.<br>
<br>	    
I once saw a crow in plain daylight.<br>
It was clawing soft, damp turf.<br>
It was stout and black, with a long strong beak.<br>
It could have been the shadow of a kingfisher,<br>
Or the kingfisher its shadow on another world.<br>
<br>
I once heard a crow on a January night.<br>
Its cries echoed in the air,<br>
Like two pieces of tarnishing silver, rubbing together,<br>
Rolling over the valleys of thick, dark night.<br>
<br>
